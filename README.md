its have two react projects

Data cleaning → remove duplicates, fix missing values.

Standardization → date formats, currencies, units.

Integration → merging data from multiple sources (e.g., sales + customer data).

Aggregation → total sales per month, per region.

Schema mapping → align data with warehouse schema (e.g., star/snowflake schema).




That’s a great question—you’re right that **cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, Snowflake, etc.) are expensive if used without caution**, but beginners can learn **the core concepts and practice for free or at very low cost**.

Here’s a **step-by-step beginner-friendly roadmap for learning cloud for data engineering** without burning money:

---

## 🌐 Step 1: Understand Cloud Basics (Free Resources First)

Before touching AWS/GCP/Azure, focus on **concepts**:

* What is **cloud computing**? (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
* What is a **data lake vs. data warehouse**?
* How data moves: ingestion → storage → transformation → analytics

📖 Free courses:

* [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials (Free)](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials/)
* [Google Cloud Fundamentals (Free tier)](https://cloud.google.com/training)
* [Microsoft Learn: Azure Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/azure/)

---

## 🆓 Step 2: Use Free Tiers & Sandboxes

Almost all major providers give **always-free tiers**:

* **AWS Free Tier** (12 months free):

  * S3 (storage, 5 GB free)
  * RDS (750 hours of free DB usage/month)
  * Lambda (1M requests free)
  * Glue/Athena (limited but useful for practice)

* **Google Cloud Free Tier** (always free):

  * BigQuery (1 TB query + 10 GB storage free per month)
  * Cloud Storage (5 GB free)
  * Firestore/Bigtable (free ops)

* **Azure Free Account** (12 months free + \$200 credit):

  * Free services include Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage, Synapse trials

⚠️ **Tip**: Always set **budget alerts** to avoid surprise bills.

---

## 💻 Step 3: Practice Locally First (No Cloud Cost)

You don’t need cloud right away—many tools run locally:

* **PostgreSQL / MySQL** → practice relational DBs.
* **MongoDB (Community Edition)** → practice NoSQL DBs.
* **Apache Spark** → run locally on your laptop for big data basics.
* **Airflow** → orchestrate pipelines locally.
* **Docker** → simulate cloud-like environments on your machine.

This way, you understand **data engineering workflows** before moving to the cloud.

---

## 🛠 Step 4: Beginner Projects Without Paid Cloud

Here are beginner-friendly projects you can do on **local + free cloud tiers**:

1. **ETL Pipeline (Local → Cloud)**

   * Extract data from a CSV/JSON API.
   * Transform using Python (Pandas).
   * Load into PostgreSQL (local) or BigQuery (free tier).

2. **Data Lake + Warehouse**

   * Store raw CSV files in AWS S3 or GCP Storage (free).
   * Query with AWS Athena or BigQuery (free queries).

3. **Streaming Pipeline (Kafka + Spark)**

   * Run Kafka locally with Docker.
   * Simulate live streaming data (like stock prices).
   * Process with Spark, load results into PostgreSQL.

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Transition to Cloud-Specific Skills

Once you’re comfortable:

* AWS: Learn **S3, RDS, Glue, Redshift, Lambda**
* GCP: Learn **BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataflow**
* Azure: Learn **Blob Storage, Data Factory, Synapse**

Focus on **one platform first** (AWS or GCP is most common in internships).

---

✅ **Summary for you as a beginner**:

1. Start with **concepts & free courses** (don’t rush to cloud).
2. Use **local tools (Postgres, Airflow, Spark)** first.
3. Try **free tiers (AWS/GCP/Azure)** carefully.
4. Build **small end-to-end data projects** and put them on GitHub.
5. Later, pick **one cloud provider** to dive deeper.
